Hi!  I am a lawyer making free software tools to make the lives of other lawyers easier.

- [Generate Chronology](https://generate-chronology.3willows.xyz/).  Convert a paragraph-referenced Microsoft Word (.docx) document to a paragraph-referenced chronology.  [Source Code](https://github.com/3willows/Generate-chronology-alpha).

- [Chronology of a Judgment](https://chronology.3willows.xyz/).  View recent UK judgments as a chronology, i.e. a paragraphed-referenced table of paragraphs mentioning a date.  [Source Code](https://github.com/3willows/Chronology-of-a-Judgment)

In the pipelines:

- Date calculator.  Tool to help lawyers calculate date to file documents as per relevant practice directions.
- Affirmation online.  A browser interface to help draft an affirmation. 
  
For software developers

- [html-css-export-word](https://github.com/3willows/html-css-export-word), a resusitated tool to convert CSS-styled HTML documents into a Word (.doc) document.  [Interactive demo](https://3willows.github.io/html-css-export-word-demo/)

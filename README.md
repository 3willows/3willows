Hi!  I am a frontend developer in React and Typescript.

<br/>
<br/>
Here you can see some of my projects, all of which I am tinkering over:

- [John Selden's Table-talk](https://3willows.github.io/johnSeldenTableTalk/): Mobile friendly 17th century e-book
- [Quick Affirmation](https://3willows.github.io/quickAffirmation/): Online bilingual template (Chinese/English)
- [Book of Spells](3willows.github.io/BookOfSpells/): Simple Harry Potter spells quiz
- [Bar Admission Bundle](https://3willows.github.io/barAdmission/):Online template for Hong Kong pupil barristers

You can also take a look at my notes on learning Javascript and Typescript in this Github-hosted [blog](https://3willows.github.io).

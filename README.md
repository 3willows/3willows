Hi!  I am a frontend developer in React and Typescript.

Currently focused on building [html-css-export-word](https://github.com/3willows/html-css-export-word), an npm package offering a rough and ready way to convert CSS-styled HTML to Word.  For a demo click the demo page of [Bar Admission Bundle](https://3willows.github.io/barAdmission/).

Some past deployed projects:
- [John Selden's Table-talk](https://3willows.github.io/johnSeldenTableTalk/): Mobile friendly 17th century e-book with only vanilla HTML and CSS.
- [Quick Affirmation](https://3willows.github.io/quickAffirmation/): Online bilingual template (Chinese/English) (under active development)
- [Book of Spells](https://3willows.github.io/BookOfSpells/): Simple Harry Potter spells quiz

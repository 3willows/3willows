Hi!  I am a frontend engineer, currently exploring Next.js + Supabase.

Past projects:-

- [Book of Spells](https://3willows.github.io/BookOfSpells/): Simple Harry Potter spells quiz
- [Quick Affirmation](https://3willows.github.io/quickAffirmation/): Online bilingual template (Chinese/English)
- [John Selden's Table-talk](https://3willows.github.io/johnSeldenTableTalk/): Mobile friendly 17th century e-book
- [Bar Admission Bundle](https://3willows.github.io/barAdmission/): generate correctly formatted legal Word documents online (starting with papers for lawyers' admission).
- [html-css-export-word](https://github.com/3willows/html-css-export-word), an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-css-export-word) offering a rough and ready way to convert CSS-styled HTML to Word.  Cf. this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/78373506/19767032) on similiar tools in existence.

Here is a quick [interactive demo](https://3willows.github.io/html-css-export-word-demo/).

Hi!  I am a full-stack developer (Javascript/MERN).

Recent projects include:

- [Bar Admission Bundle](https://3willows.github.io/barAdmission/): generate correctly formatted legal Word documents online (starting with papers for lawyers' admission).
- [html-css-export-word](https://github.com/3willows/html-css-export-word), an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-css-export-word) offering a rough and ready way to convert CSS-styled HTML to Word.  Cf. this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/78373506/19767032) on similiar tools in existence.

Here is a quick [interactive demo](https://3willows.github.io/html-css-export-word-demo/).

Hi!  I am a frontend developer in React and Typescript.

Here you can see some of my projects, all of which I am tinkering over:

- [John Selden's Table-talk](https://3willows.github.io/johnSeldenTableTalk/): Mobile friendly 17th century e-book
- [Quick Affirmation](https://3willows.github.io/quickAffirmation/): Online bilingual template (Chinese/English)
- [Book of Spells](https://3willows.github.io/BookOfSpells/): Simple Harry Potter spells quiz
- [Bar Admission Bundle](https://3willows.github.io/barAdmission/): Online template for Hong Kong pupil barristers

I also record my journey into web development in the 2020s [here](https://3willows.github.io).

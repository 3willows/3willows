Hi!  I am a frontend developer (React and Typescript).  You can read about my journey into web development in the 2020s [here](https://3willows.github.io).

Currently focused on building [html-css-export-word](https://github.com/3willows/html-css-export-word), an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-css-export-word) offering a rough and ready way to convert CSS-styled HTML to Word.  For my research into similiar tools already in existence, see this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/78373506/19767032).

For a quick demo, click the button at the lower right corner [here](https://3willows.github.io/barAdmission/#/info).  This has been tested on Microsoft for Mac, but not otherwise: if you have any suggestions for testing/improvement please open a [Github issue](https://github.com/3willows/html-css-export-word/issues)/make a PR.

Hi!  I am a frontend developer in React and Typescript.

Currently focused on building [html-css-export-word](https://github.com/3willows/html-css-export-word), an [npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/html-css-export-word) offering a rough and ready way to convert CSS-styled HTML to Word.  For my research into similiar tools already in existence, see this [StackOverflow answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/78373506/19767032).

For a quick demo, click the button at the lower right corner [here](https://3willows.github.io/barAdmission/#/info).  This has been tested on Microsoft for Mac, but not otherwise: if you have any suggestions for testing/improvement please open a [Github issue](https://github.com/3willows/html-css-export-word/issues)/make a PR.

Some past deployed projects:
- [John Selden's Table-talk](https://3willows.github.io/johnSeldenTableTalk/): Mobile friendly 17th century e-book with only vanilla HTML and CSS
- [Quick Affirmation](https://3willows.github.io/quickAffirmation/): Online bilingual template (Chinese/English) (under active development)
- [Book of Spells](https://3willows.github.io/BookOfSpells/): Simple Harry Potter spells quiz
